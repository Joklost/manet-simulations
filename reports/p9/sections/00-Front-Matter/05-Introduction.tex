\chapter{Introduction}

%Reachi is a coordinated effort to enable vital communication during emergencies such as natural disasters, where earthquakes, tsunamis, forest fires, and more, destroy the pre-existing communication infrastructure, rendering it near impossible to organise the relief effort to effectively aid the affected, assess the damage, as well as organising repairs to the damaged infrastructure. The goal of the Reachi project is to optimise the disaster response by creating an overview of the situation within the first eight hours after the disaster. Today, this process can take up 1-2 weeks, due to the destruction of pre-existing communication infrastructure~\cite{website:reachiproject}. Without this overview, it is impossible to know where the needs for disaster relief is greatest, or what the level of disaster relief is even available. The project has been developed by the danish company LinkAiders ApS, and utilise a technology to enable mobile ad-hoc mesh networking through radio communication, created by NeoCortec.

%To date, the largest scale drill of the Reachi system was conducted in September 2018, in the Phillippines, with the help of 320 volunteers. The drill was conducted in order to test the Reachi system as a needs assessment tool, the volunteers' ability to use the Reachi devices, as well as the ability of the Reachi system to create the necessary overview of the situation, in less than eight hours. A video of the drill has been uploaded to the LinkAiders ApS YouTube channel, and the link is encoded in the QR Code in \autoref{figure:introduction:reachi-test}. \medbreak

%The goal for the Reachi project is to scale, and test, the project with up to 1000 devices~\cite{website:reachiproject}, which is a massive undertaking, and would require even more effort to organise such a drill. Our project proposes a C++ library for writing, and running, simulations of the network protocol behind the mesh communication in a \gls{manet}, using state-of-the-art modelling of link \gls{pathloss} behind the radio communication, to simulate packet loss and collisions caused by interference. With our library, it would be possible to write a C++ implementation of communication protocols, such as \gls{lmac}~\cite{paper:lmac_protocol} or Slotted ALOHA~\cite{Roberts:1975:APS:1024916.1024920}, using a simple interface header file resembling a traditional hardware interface.

% - motivation / aim
% - Why do the project?
%Verifying that \gls{manet} protocols work as intended, is essential if the protocol is to be used in a real world setting, especially in critically important settings. Testing a \gls{manet} protocol with many nodes and emulating the setting the protocol will be used in can be problematic, as the setting might be hard to recreate in a way that makes the collection of data possible or creating a large enough network.\medbreak
% tickle some more
% - Run the actual software, in a realistic setting


%This gives reason to develop a framework, capable of simulating arbitrary \gls{manet} protocols. Designing the framework to run on a cluster will allow for the usage of \gls{mpi}, thus increasing the possible scale and speed of the simulation.
%Since the protocols are of the wireless nature, we need a way to simulate the probability of loosing a packet or the packet containing errors. In other words calculating the \gls{pep}.

%At the time of writing, there exists several well-established \gls{mpi} implementations for several languages. Our framework will utilise one of those well-established implementations and add a layer on top of that, where the \gls{pep} calculations will happen.

%Lastly we will test the framework on an \gls{manet} protocol, on the cluster available at Aalborg University, to verify that the framework works on a real world protocol.



blah blah \gls{manet}\medbreak


Testing \gls{manet}'s comes with several complications. 
When testing \gls{manet} protocol, or just network protocols in general, scale is important. Testing the protocol on a network of the size of a real world scenario gives the best insight in the behaviour of the protocol. Even better would be to test on a network larger than anticipated, to stress test and observer worst case scenarios.
Another problem accompanied with the scaling problem, is the physical units that are to be used for the test. Testing with the units that the protocol will be deployed with, is the ideal scenario, but that is not always possible. Fabricating the units is both expensive and time consuming, eg. the desired network size is 1000 nodes. Then 1000 units would have to be fabricated and set up.
Another problem is repeatability. To run a test with physical units, test personal is needed. The test personal will have to move around in the world, in predefined patterns to test several different network topologies. When a lot of people is involved it gets complicated to keep everything coordinated, whilst no guarantee that when the test is repeated, the test personal will behave in the exact same way thereby not producing consistent test results.\medbreak

To solve the above mentioned issues, this paper intends to develop a framework for simulating \gls{manet} protocols. The framework will emulate the physical units that would normally run the \gls{manet} protocol, on Aalborg University's compute cluster. Each emulated unit, is emulated as a process in a \gls{mpi} setting, allowing one to emulate a large amount of network nodes. Though the size of the cluster decides the possible amount of emulated nodes. The hardware will then be simulated, on the emulated units. Since the hardware is entirely software, it allows for simulating any kind of hardware that would be used in physical units running \gls{manet} protocols.\medbreak

When emulating physical units, it is important to consider the conditions that the unit are to be used in. In the case of units running \gls{manet} protocols, its that the communication between nodes in the network will influenced by the terrain. Bit errors might happen, when transmitting a message over the network, because of obstacles interfering with the signal, hence the framework must also emulate that behaviour. This is done by calculating the \gls{pep} based on a calculated link model, that will continuously be updated throughout the simulations lifetime.





%  Don't write so much about Reachi. This project was not about Reachi.
%  Motivation should be more general, instead of mentioning neocortec. Mention what the goal of the project is.
%
%  It takes a long time, its complicated to run it in terrain. Testing on real units is expensive, repeatibility is a problem.
%  Scalability is a big challenge, repeatabiltiy is another. The possiblity to simulate different scenarios, where it would be difficult to instruct volunteers to perform these scenarios.
%
%  We emulate the physical units, where the hardware is simulated by software.
%
%  Be very clear of what we are actually doing!
%  What is simulated, what is emulated, and how do we deal with these issues?
%
%  Try to avoid things like we will present, or we would like to be able to.
