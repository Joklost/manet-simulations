% Motivation,
A Mobile Ad-hoc Network is a decentralised wireless network that require no pre-existing infrastructure to function. Nodes communicate in the network using radio, and require networking protocols to provide energy efficient communication. The aim of this project is to simulate the protocols, and to provide an alternative to real-life testing, as scaling a real-life test requires a significant amount of effort and investment of both money and time. The goal is to be able to perform repeatable experiments in a control topology environment with up to 1000 devices, faster than a real-life scenario.

We propose a C++ library for writing, and running, simulations of mobile ad-hoc networking protocols, using MPI. With this library, it is possible to write C++ implementations of communication protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks, such as ALOHA or LMAC, and perform repeatable experiments on these using our library, where we emulate the physical hardware, and simulate the radio communication between the emulated hardware with state-of-the-art modelling of link path loss, packet error and collisions.

We introduce the notion of virtual time, where we are able to skip long periods of inactivity when simulating wireless networking protocols, running hour long protocols in a matter of minutes.
