\section{Optimising the Link Model}\label{sec:optimization}
In this section we explore two methods for optimising the computational time required for computing the link model introduced in \autoref{sec:linkmodel}. \autoref{sec:cholesky} presents the Cholesky decomposition, along with the issues we have experienced in using the decomposition. In \autoref{sec:clustering}, the clustering addition to the link model is presented, along with a formalised problem statement and discussion of the choice of algorithm, and its implementation.
