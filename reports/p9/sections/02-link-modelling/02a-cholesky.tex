\subsection{The Cholesky Decomposition}\label{sec:cholesky}
In \autoref{sec:simulatingvalues}, we utilised the Cholesky decomposition on the covariance matrix in the stochastic shadow fading part. The Cholesky decomposition is a decomposition algorithm for \gls{symmetric}, \gls{pd-matrix} into the product of a \gls{lt-matrix} and its \gls{conjugate-transpose}, and is primarily used for solving systems of linear equations~\cite{Press:2007:NRE:1403886}.

% \subsection{Cholesky decomposition}\label{sec:cholesky}
%In this section we present and describe the Cholesky decomposition, and the problem it creates for our computation time, and how we propose to optimise the decomposition algorithm for our particular needs.

% The cholesky decomposition or cholesky factorization is a matrix decomposition, of a positive-definite matrix, resulting in a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose.

%In \autoref{sec:linkmodel} we utilise the Cholesky decomposition in \autoref{eq:pathlossstoch}. The Cholesky decomposition is a matrix decomposition, on a \gls{pd-matrix}. The decomposition results in a \gls{lt-matrix} and its \gls{conjugate-transpose}. The Cholesky decomposition is an expensive computation of cubic time complexity, as such we intend to speed up the algorithm. Furthermore since the decomposition requires an \gls{pd-matrix} to work, we choose to verify our auto-correlation matrix before decomposing it, to ensure that the decomposition will run correctly.

% In \autoref{sec:linkmodel} we utilise the Cholesky decomposition. The Cholesky decomposition is an expensive computation of cubic time complexity and, as such, it needs to be more efficient for our use case. 

%Initially we propose to optimise the algorithm by changing the data structure from a matrix to an ordered map of key-value pairs. The keys will a tuple of links and the value will be the result of the auto-correlation function from \autoref{eq:pathlossautocorrelation}.\medbreak



%, where the pair will be sorted after the link with the largest id, will be the first element in the pair, eg. $l_1.id = 1$ and $l_2.id = 2$ then $key = (l_2, l_1)$. The map must be ordered since the cholesky decomposition uses previous calculated values, to calculate the next.
