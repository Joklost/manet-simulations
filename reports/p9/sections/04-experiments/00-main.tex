\chapter{Experiments}\label{ch:experiments}
In this chapter we will present a pseudo code description of the Slotted ALOHA protocol~\cite{Roberts:1975:APS:1024916.1024920}, using the hardware functions from \autoref{sec:mpiprotocol}, and present an experiment showing the time required to run the simulation with a different number of time slots.
