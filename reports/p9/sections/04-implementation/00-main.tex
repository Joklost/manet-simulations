\chapter{Message Passing Interface}
%In this chapter, we will introduce our \gls{mpi} library.

To be able to simulate radio communication using \gls{mpi}, we want to expose a series of functions, such that \gls{manet} nodes will be able to communicate with each other. This will be done in two parts. The first part is a set of hardware emulating functions to enable transmission and reception of data packets between nodes. This part is introduced in \autoref{sec:mpiprotocol}. The second part is a centralised controller, used to control the networking between the nodes. The controller is presented in \autoref{sec:mpicontroller}. Finally, \autoref{sec:saloha} presents the Slotted ALOHA protocol, as a sample \gls{tdma} protocol that we can simulate using our \gls{mpi}.
