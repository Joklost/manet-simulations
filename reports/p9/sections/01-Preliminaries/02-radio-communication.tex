    \item[Transmission power] \todo[inline]{find sauce}
    \item[\gls{rssi}] \gls{rssi} is an indication of the power level of a received signal, in the receiver radio. The measurement is measured after the possible loss uncured by the radio and/or cable. The \gls{rssi} minimum and maximum values are not standardised. The manufactures of the specific chips decided that, eg. Cisco systems \gls{rssi} range from 0-100, while Atheros range from 0-60 \cite{website:rssi-metageek}.
    \item[Baud rate] The baud rate is a measure of symbols per second. In the citation, they describe it in the context of serial ports, but in this case the symbols are bits \cite{website:baudrate-mathworks}.
