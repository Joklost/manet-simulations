% Depending on the intended usage for the \gls{manet} protocol, the protocol might be designed to be energy efficient. This is done by setting the devices in a sleeping state to preserve energy. This poses a problem when testing the protocol, since the devices will be sleeping most of the time thereby wasting time. This gives reason to utilise virtual time instead of real time. With virtual time it is possible to speed up time, such that when all devices are in a sleeping state, that unused time where nothing will happen can be forwarded to the next point in time where a device is supposed to wake up.
