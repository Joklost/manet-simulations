    abstract = "In this paper, we present an energy-efficient medium access protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. Although the protocol uses TDMA to give nodes in the WSN the opportunity to communicate collision-free, the network is self-organizing in terms of time slot assignment and synchronization. The main goal of the medium access protocol is to minimize overhead of the physical layer. The protocol reduces the number of transceiver state switches and hence the energy wasted in preamble transmissions. The protocol is compared to SMAC and EMACs by simulation. The LMAC protocol is able to extend the network lifetime by a factor 2.4 and 3.8, compared to EMACs and SMAC respectively.",

    abstract = "In this paper we report on modelling and verification of a medium access control protocol for wireless sensor networks, the LMAC protocol. Our approach is to systematically investigate all possible connected topologies consisting of four and of five nodes. The analysis is performed by timed automaton model checking using Uppaal. The property of main interest is detecting and resolving collision. Evaluation of this property for all connected topologies requires more than 8000 model checking runs. Increasing the number of nodes would not only lead increase the state space, but to a greater extent cause an instance explosion problem. Despite the small number of nodes this approach gave valuable insight in the protocol and the scenarios that lead to collisions not detected by the protocol, and it increased the confidence in the adequacy of the protocol.",
