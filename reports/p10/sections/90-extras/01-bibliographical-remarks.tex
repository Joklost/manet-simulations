\chapter{Bibliographical Remarks}
As this project, and this thesis, was part of a multi-semester project, we have re-used parts of
our thesis from last semester~\cite{paper:massivesims1}. The following is a list of the sections that include
parts of the last thesis, and the changes that has been made to them in this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parts of the summary on page \pageref{ch:summary} is based on text from other sections in this
          thesis.
    \item The abstract on page \pageref{page:titlepage} has been adapted from the abstract on page iii in
          \cite{paper:massivesims1} to reflect the contributions and results of this project.
    \item \autoref{ch:introduction} (excluding the figure) has been adapted from Chapter 1 in
          \cite{paper:massivesims1} to reflect the contributions of this project.
    \item \autoref{sec:relatedworks} has been included from \cite{paper:massivesims1}.
    \item The introduction of \autoref{ch:radio-physics} is an adapted version of the introduction to Chapter
          2 in \cite{paper:massivesims1}.
    \item \autoref{sec:reachi-experiments} has been adapted, and shortened, from Section 2.1.2 in
          \cite{paper:massivesims1}.
    \item \autoref{sec:radiomodel} has been adapted with slight changes to the naming in some of the
          equations, to the presented example, as well as to include time for the \gls{rssi} function, to
          Section 2.2 in \cite{paper:massivesims1}. Additionally, the graphs showing the probability for packet
          error has been updated slightly.
    \item \autoref{sec:virtual-time} includes parts of Section 3.1.1 from \cite{paper:massivesims1}.
    \item \autoref{sec:hwfuncspseudo} has been adapted from Section 3.1.3 in \cite{paper:massivesims1}, to
          conform to new behaviour. Additionally, two of the functions have been renamed.
    \item \autoref{sec:coordinatorpseudo} is a heavily modified version of Section 3.2 in
          \cite{paper:massivesims1}. The name and functionality of the Coordinator have changed greatly from
          the Centralised Controller of \cite{paper:massivesims1}, but the Coordinator still has basis in this
          section.
    \item The beginning of \autoref{ch:conclusion} has been adapted from Chapter 5 in
          \cite{paper:massivesims1}.
