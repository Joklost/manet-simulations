        %\todo[inline]{bibliographical remark: no changes yet}
        A \gls{manet} is a decentralised wireless network where nodes communicate directly with each other
        using radio and require \gls{mac} protocols to provide energy efficient communication. This aim of
        this project is to simulate the \gls{mac} protocols and to provide an alternative to real-life
        testing. The goal is to be able to perform repeatable experiments in a controlled topology environment
        with up to 1000 nodes. We propose a C++ library for writing and running, simulations of \gls{manet}s,
        using \acrshort{mpi}. With this library, it is possible to write C++ implementations of communication
        and \gls{mac} protocols, for \gls{manet}s, such as ALOHA or LMAC, and perform repeatable experiments,
        where our library emulate the physical radio hardware and simulate radio communication between the
        emulated hardware. We propose a method for modelling link \gls{pathloss} using building footprints
        between nodes, on OpenStreetMap map tiles, modelling using real-life field measurements.

        %that requires no pre-existing
        %infrastructure to function. Nodes communicate in the network using radio, and require networking protocols to
        %provide energy efficient communication. 
        
        %The aim of this project is to simulate the protocols, and to provide
        %an alternative to real-life testing, as scaling a real-life test requires a significant amount of effort and
        %investment of both money and time. The goal is to be able to perform repeatable experiments in a controlled
        %topology environment with up to 1000 devices.

        %We propose a C++ library for writing, and running, simulations of mobile ad-hoc networking protocols, using
        %MPI. With this library, it is possible to write C++ implementations of communication protocols for mobile
        %ad-hoc networks, such as ALOHA or LMAC, and perform repeatable experiments on these using our library, where
        %we emulate the physical hardware, and simulate the radio communication between the emulated hardware with
        %state-of-the-art modelling of link path loss, packet error and collisions.
%
        %We introduce the notion of virtual time, where we are able to skip long periods of inactivity when simulating
        %wireless networking protocols.
