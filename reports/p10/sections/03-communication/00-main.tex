\chapter{Communication}\label{ch:communication}
In this chapter, we introduce the \acrfull{mpi} for emulating the radio functionality of wireless nodes. The
interface consists of three parts: An interface for nodes to communicate, emulating radio hardware
functionality, a Coordinator to coordinate the communication between nodes, and a set of low-level hardware
functions for transmitting, listening, and sleeping, used by the interface. The hardware interface is
introduced in \autoref{sec:interface}, the Coordinator is presented in \autoref{sec:coordinator}, and the
hardware functions are presented in \autoref{sec:hwfuncspseudo}. Finally \autoref{sec:correctness} will
present a proof of correctness for our interface and the Coordinator, where we show that a simulated
execution, using \gls{mpi}, will behave the same as a real execution. \medbreak
