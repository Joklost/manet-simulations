\chapter{Communication}\label{ch:communication}
In this chapter, we introduce the \acrfull{mpi} for emulating the radio functionality of wireless nodes. The
interface consists of three parts: An interface for nodes to communicate, emulating radio hardware
functionality, a Coordinator to coordinate the communication between nodes, and a set of low-level hardware
functions for transmitting, listening, and sleeping. The hardware interface is introduced in
\autoref{sec:interface}, the Coordinator is presented in \autoref{sec:coordinator}, and the hardware functions
are presented in \autoref{sec:hwfuncspseudo}. Finally \autoref{sec:correctness} will present arguments of
correctness for our interface and the Coordinator, where we show that a simulated execution, using \gls{mpi},
will behave the same as a real execution.
