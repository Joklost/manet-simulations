\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
%\bibtodo{changed to reflect new work}
A \gls{manet} is a decentralised wireless network that requires no pre-existing infrastructure, such as
routers or access points~\cite{inproceedings:routingsurvery}. Instead, each node in the ad-hoc network are
battery powered, and communicates directly with each-other using a radio. Due to this, \gls{manet}s rely on
wireless networking protocols to provide energy efficient communication in the network. Because of the ad-hoc
nature of \gls{manet}s, common applications consist of enabling communication in emergency situations such as
natural disasters, or for military conflicts.\smallbreak

% Outline the goal
The goal of this project is to simulate wireless network protocols for communication in a mobile setting.
Ideally the capabilities of a wireless network protocol are tested in a real-life scenario, using physical
devices for radio communication. This poses interesting challenges such as scalability, and repeatability.
Scaling a real-life test requires a significant amount of effort and investment of both money and time, and
repeating the same test over and over becomes near impossible, the larger the scale. Our goal is to be able to
perform repeatable experiments in a controlled topology environment with up to 1000 devices.\smallbreak

Our project proposes a \gls{mpi} C++ library for writing, and running, simulations of the network protocol
behind the mesh communication in a \gls{manet}, modelling link \gls{pathloss} to simulate packet loss and
collisions caused by interfering transmitters, where the physical devices, and the communication between
these, are emulated entirely using software. With our library, it is be possible to write a C++ implementation
of communication protocols, such as \gls{lmac}~\cite{paper:lmac_protocol} or Slotted
ALOHA~\cite{Roberts:1975:APS:1024916.1024920}, using a simple interface header file resembling a traditional
hardware interface, and perform simulations with these, where each physical device is emulated by different
CPUs on the MCC compute cluster at AAU~\cite{website:mccaau}. \smallbreak

% Outline contributions
The primary contribution of this project is the Coordinator that facilitate wireless communication between the
emulated physical devices. The Coordinator allow us to simulate wireless communication in virtual time, where
the Coordinator is able to skip periods of inactivity, reducing the time required to run real-time
simulations. In addition to this, we propose a method for modelling and computing link \gls{pathloss} using
building footprints between nodes of a link, on OpenStreetMap map tiles obtained via the Mapbox Maps Service
API~\cite{website:mapbox}. Finally, we propose extensions to a network topology visualisation tool created by
Peter GjÃ¸l Jensen, in which we are now able to visualise communication and protocol logs, generated by running
simulations our library.
