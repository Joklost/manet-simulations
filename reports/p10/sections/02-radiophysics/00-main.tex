\chapter{Radio Physics}\label{ch:radio-physics}
%\bibtodo{from original report}
The goal of this chapter is to be able to estimate the probability, based on the topology of a wireless
network, of how likely it is that packet loss will happen during transmission between two nodes.

%\autoref{sec:linkmodel} presents the method for simulating the link model in a \gls{manet}, \autoref{sec:pep}
%presents the method for computing the packet loss probability during a transmission, and
%\autoref{sec:optimization} proposes two ways for optimising the computational time required to compute the
%link model.

\autoref{figure:manetwithter} shows a sample wireless network topology for a \acrfull{manet}. The network
consists of mobile devices (nodes), and the communication between these (links). Nodes are
\doublequote{linked} with other nodes when they can communicate wirelessly. Wireless communication relies on
the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves~\cite[p.~10]{paper:linkmodel} (radio signals), and the
strength, or quality, of a wireless link, is described by the signal loss occurring when propagating the
signal from transmitter to receiver, and is measured by the \gls{rssi} (a negative value, where a value close
to 0 is better). In \cite{paper:linkmodel}, the term \gls{pathloss} is used to describe this signal loss and
is determined in part by the physical distance between transmitter and receiver, but also by physical objects
and terrain, like buildings or forests. A major consideration for mobile networks is that the topology is
dynamic. Nodes move around, causing links to disappear, or new links to appear, thus changing the topology of
the network. \autoref{sec:visualiser} introduces the Visualiser and presents the proposed extensions.
\autoref{sec:hardwarephysics} introduces a series radio specific terms we use throughout the thesis.
\autoref{sec:reachi-experiments} presents the link \gls{pathloss} model from \cite{paper:linkmodel}, and
\autoref{sec:linkmodel} introduces an alternative \gls{pathloss} model based on building footprints between
nodes in a links, by using OpenStreetMap map tiles. Finally, \autoref{sec:radiomodel} presents the method for
simulating packet loss and transmission interference.

%\autoref{sec:linkmodel} will elaborate
%further on the \gls{pathloss} of a link, as well as present a method for simulating the \gls{pathloss} for a
%mobile network topology.
