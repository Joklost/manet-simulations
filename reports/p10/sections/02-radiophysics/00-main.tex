\chapter{Radio Physics}\label{ch:radio-physics}
%\bibtodo{from original report}
The goal of this chapter is to be able to estimate the probability, based on the topology of a wireless
network, of how likely it is that packet loss will happen during a transmission between two nodes.

%\autoref{sec:linkmodel} presents the method for simulating the link model in a \gls{manet}, \autoref{sec:pep}
%presents the method for computing the packet loss probability during a transmission, and
%\autoref{sec:optimization} proposes two ways for optimising the computational time required to compute the
%link model.

\autoref{figure:manetwithter} shows a sample wireless network topology for a \acrfull{manet}. The network
consists of mobile devices (nodes), and the communication between these (links). Nodes are
\doublequote{linked} with other nodes when they are able to communicate wirelessly. Wireless communication
relies on the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves~\cite[p.~10]{paper:linkmodel} (radio
signals), and the strength, or quality, of a wireless link is described by the signal loss occurring when
propagating the signal from transmitter to receiver, and is measured by the \gls{rssi} (a negative value,
where a value close to 0 is better). In \cite{paper:linkmodel}, the term \gls{pathloss} is used to describe
this signal loss, and is determined in part by the physical distance between transmitter and receiver, but
also by physical objects and terrain, like buildings or forests. A major consideration for mobile networks is
that the topology is dynamic. Nodes move around, causing links to disappear, or new links to appear, thus mast
changing the topology of the network.

%\autoref{sec:linkmodel} will elaborate
%further on the \gls{pathloss} of a link, as well as present a method for simulating the \gls{pathloss} for a
%mobile network topology.
