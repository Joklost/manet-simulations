\chapter{Experiments}\label{ch:experiments}
In this chapter, we present the \gls{lmac} protocol~\cite{paper:lmac_protocol}, as
well as some fragments of a C++ implementation of the protocol, in \autoref{sec:lmacc}. In
\autoref{sec:scalability} we present a scalability experiment of the \gls{mpi} and the Coordinator, running
with the \gls{lmac} protocol.

\todo[inline]{Should we include ALOHA?}
