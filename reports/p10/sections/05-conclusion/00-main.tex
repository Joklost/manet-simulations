\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
\bibtodo{adapted from report}
In this report, we introduce a C++ library for writing, and running, simulations of the \gls{mac} protocols
behind the mesh communication in a \gls{manet} using a \gls{mpi}. Our library consists of X parts: A hardware
interface header file, used for writing implementations of \gls{mac} protocols, that emulate the physical part
of a device in a \gls{manet}, a Coordinator, facilitating and coordinating the communication between the
emulated devices, and finally the link model, where we can annotate network topology \gls{gps} logs with links
between nodes, based on a model for link \gls{pathloss}, where we approximate the \gls{pathloss} for a link
using building footprints between the nodes of a link, on OpenStreetMap map tiles. With the annotated
\gls{gps} logs, we are able to simulate wireless radio communication, through the Coordinator, where we can
simulate packet errors and collisions caused by interfering transmissions or bad links. \smallbreak

% Conclude on building method vs angle method.

% Arguments for correctness

In \autoref{ch:experiments}, we show how our C++ library can be used to simulate the \gls{lmac} protocol, and
we present the results of our scalability experiments for the Coordinator. We do, however, face significant
scalability problems, as we rely on a single centralised Coordinator.

% We added extensions to the Visualiser tool, to visualise communication and protocol logs, in order to replay
% a simulation.
